# Voxellery

A gallery for voxel art, because we love it!

Frontend built in React, backend built in Django, vibes built in the Caribbean ðŸŒ´

## Features

This project is a simple public gallery (think [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)) for Voxel Art. Users can:

- View all uploaded voxel art images
- Upload voxel art to be displayed
- Like voxel art from other users

## Requirements

To run this app you need Docker (4.20+) installed locally.

## Why Make This?

I like making voxel art with [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io). It's fun!

## Architecture

### DB Schema

## Challenges

- Django's learning curve. It's been about 4 years since I used Django, and it's a lot of concepts to recall to get going
- Customising the user auth in Django isn't a simple switch. The docs have a useful guide, but there are few components to change to get it working
  - Particularly, in this app the email is the unique field for users, and username is their display name. Not required, this change was done more out of curiousity
- I'd planned for the React app to be deployed separately, and statically hosted. So I needed to learn how to get a JWT and permissions set up for the backend
